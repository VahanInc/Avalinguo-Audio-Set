# Avalinguo-Audio-Set
Avalinguo Audio Set: Dataset for Speaker Fluency Level Classification 

In this repository I will be maintaining and uploading the files of an audio set that I have been constructing over the past couple of months. 

I will be describing the details and characteristics of this repository. 

In another repository, I will be uploading the audio analysis that I have been doing to this data set. I have performed feature extraction and implemented ML models to classify the audio segments according to their labeled classes.
