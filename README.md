# Avalinguo-Audio-Dataset: Dataset for Speaker Fluency Level Classification 

[Download](#download) | [A peek inside](#a-peek-inside)

The **Avalinguo Audio Dataset** is a labeled audio collection of 1424 audio recordings consisting of 3 fluency classes, average 450 audio clips (segments) per class, total of ca. 2 hours recordings, 5 seconds non-overlapped segments.segments have sample rates ranging from 22050 Hz to 48000 Hz, mono and multi-channel and have MP3 format.

This audio set is suitable for performing speaker fluency level classification since it is a collection of recordings of people whose language fluency ranges from low to high. The audio files have the following characteristics:

- Spontaneous (non-scripted) conversations
- Random conversation topics
- Audios recorded with low-to-no background noise

The three fluency classes are:

- Low fluency: Person can understand frequently used expressions and give basic personal information. Person can talk about simple things on familiar topics but still speaks with unnatural pauses.
- Intermediate fluency: Person Can deal with common situations, for example, traveling and restaurant ordering. Describes experiences and events and is capable of giving reasons, opinions or plans. Can still make some unnatural pauses.
- High fluency: Can speak without unnatural pauses (no hesitation), doesn’t pause long to find expressions. Can use the language in a flexible way for social, academic, and professional purposes.

Clips have been constructed from public recordings gathered from Youtube, recordings of English students at Tecnológico de Monterrey (ITESM) and by Friends/Family of the author.
